Description: datanodes is intended for the incremental redaction of analysis code
    in R scripts, R Markdown or knitr documents. It is in essence similar to the
    caching functionality of knitr, but available from the console; i.e., without
    having to knit the document to profit from the cache.
    In addition to the simmple caching functionality, it also allows to specify
    dependencies among cache files and a dependent datanode will be updated only
    one of its dependencies was updated.
